##Problem Statement
Help people get to know each other through the typical form of ice breakers, but a twist.
Along with lightweight 'get to know you questions', there are darker questions to evoke humor and possibly lively discussion.

-- WHO
Large gatherings of people
-- WHAT
Get people to socialize more deeply, faster.
-- WHEN
First meeting each other
-- WHERE
At large gatherings
-- WHY
To get people to know each other quicker in awkward situations


##User Story:

First day of GA;
Everyone is standing in a circle awkwardly wanting to get to know each other
using our app on the LIGHT setting, a random easy going ice breaker is generated for each person, such as "what is your guilty pleather" as they answer a randomly generated question going around the circle.

LATER THAT DAY... AT THE BAR... Turn it all the way up to the DARK setting to generate irreverent ice breakers such as "Do you own a gun" or "Have you paid for or have paid for sex"? Jokingly getting people out of their comfort zone and getting to know each other very personally.

LIGHT setting or DARK setting, our good and evil ice breaker app is sure to help people get to know each other from the shiny surface the dark depths of our souls.
